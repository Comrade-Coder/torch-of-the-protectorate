 TOTP_NAME:0 "Torch of the Protectorate"
 TOTP_DESC:0 "Following the ascension of Henry Lawrence to Lord Protector of the Protectorate, it became clear that life without a king would be the new norm. With endurance and reforms through the years, the protectorate adapted while Europe remained petty as always. The empires of old are all that is known, science moves on but the ideals stay stagnant."
